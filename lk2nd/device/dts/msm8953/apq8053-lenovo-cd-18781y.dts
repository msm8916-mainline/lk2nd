/*
 * This device has a few quirks you need to keep in mind when building and
 * flashing lk2nd:
 *
 * 1. The stock bootloader does not like images built with embedded QCDT.
 *    Therefor LK2ND_QCDTBS="" must be set when building.
 *
 * 2. While the bootloader can be unlocked using `fastboot oem-unlock` the
 *    device's lk bootloader will crash as long as the bootloader remains
 *    unlocked. Therefor:
 *      - Secure Boot can not be disabled
 *
 *        However, the device will happily boot any AVB1 signed image.
 *        Build the image using the following make command to have it
 *        appropriately signed during build:
 *
 *          make TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX=arm-none-eabi- SIGN_BOOTIMG=1 \
 *               LK2ND_QCDTBS="" lk2nd-msm8953
 *
 *      - lk2nd cannot be flashed in fastboot mode
 *
 *        Instead, use EDL (https://github.com/bkerler/edl) to write the signed
 *        lk2nd.img to the boot partition.
 *        For example:
 *
 *          edl w boot build-lk2nd-msm8953/lk2nd.img
